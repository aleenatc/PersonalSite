        <h2>Discussing Playlists</h2>
        <p>Music is an amazingly complex artistic form of expression that is truly able to capture human emotion through the usage of sounds. Music itself has gone
        through many types of revolutions, from the Harlem Renaissance of the 1930s to the Rock and Roll Era of the 50s to 60s defined by Elvis, to the Era of Pop defined
        by Michael Jackson. The modern age of music encompasses all of these elements through its genres of hip-hop, rap, RnB, and the countless other genres that artists
        not only redefine through their voice but create, break, and innovate with.</p>

        <p>My music playlist covers a variety of genres that include music from countless categories, some of which I have listed below. These include artists such as Lana Del Rey,
        The Weeknd, Doja Cat, and many more. They cover a variety of genres from rop to hip hop to pop, and focus more on modern music of the 2010s and 2020s. For reference, we list some
        of the songs from our playlist here.</p>
